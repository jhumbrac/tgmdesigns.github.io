	<p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my page. My name is Taylor and I'm an artist-turned-graphic designer. I've loved drawing and painting my whole life and in 2011 I began to put it to good use. Once I learned Adobe Creative Suite, the sky was the limit and I began to take on all sorts of projects.</p>
	
	<ul>As a graphic designer, I now offer:</ul>
	<li>Logo design</li>
	<li>Packaging design</li>
	<li>Image retouching</li>
	<li>Graphic design</li>
	<li>Cover art</li>
	<li>And coming soon...website design!</li>

	<br>

	<p>If you would like to get in touch, please <a href="mailto:taylorgmansfield@gmail.com">email me</a>. Or, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/art.by.tgm/">Instagram page</a>. Have a great day!</p>
